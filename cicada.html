 <p>1. The Scientific name of Cicada is Cicadoidea</p>   
2. The body of a cicada is similar to that of a violin or a guitar, in that much of it consists of empty, air-filled spaces that act like a resonating chamber and amplify the sound they generate.
<p>3. Remember those clicker toys made from thin metal, often shaped and painted like a frog? Where you use your thumb to push and release a flexible tongue on the underside to make noise? Male cicadas produce sound in a very similar way, Hall says.</p>
4. “The adult female lays her eggs into twigs,” Hall says. “When the eggs hatch, an immature stage— called a nymph—falls onto the ground, where it will then burrow. The nymph lives underground and feeds on plant roots with its piercing-sucking mouth parts, moving along chambers and tunnels that it digs with its strong, clawlike front legs.

<p>5. “They’re very difficult to get to,” Hall says. “You can hear them, but once you start walking to a tree, it’s very hard to home in on them. I think it’s because the sound is so big, it’s hard to narrow where it’s coming from, even if you think you know where it’s coming from. That is a good strategy of distracting a predator. If you walk up to a branch or a twig that the cicada is on, it’ll move around to the back side and hide. Also, they stop calling as soon as you get too close, making it even more difficult to find them.”</p>
6. “One of their enemies is the cicada killer wasp,” Hall says. “These are wasps that home in on cicadas, much like the tarantula wasp seeks out tarantulas. The female wasp flies around searching for cicadas, and when it finds one, it stings it and paralyzes it, then carries it to a burrow, lays one egg on it, and then closes the burrow up. It’s a good-size wasp, because you have to figure it has to be able to grab the cicada and fly with it.
<p>7. “The cicada remains alive underground while the wasp larva is feeding on it. And the larva feeds at such a rate that it doesn’t immediately kill the cicada. During their underground life, some cicadas become infected with the spores of a fungus that will then grow inside their bodies, eventually killing them and sprouting a fruiting body from their heads.”</p>
8. Cicada species in Arizona range in size from the large Southwestern giant floodplain cicada, only slightly shorter than the smallest North American hummingbird, to the continent’s smallest cicada, Beameria venosa, which can sit on a quarter coin with room to spare. “In our insect collection, we have 36 species of cicadas from the state,” Hall says. “In total, there probably are about four dozen species in the state. One of the most common in the Tucson area is the Apache cicada (Diceroprocta apache).”
